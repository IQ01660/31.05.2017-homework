Being a low-level programming language, Assembly has several advantages and disadvantages. I will initiate my describing advantages. 
Firstly, this language is very close to machine language therefore it does not need as much memory and is relatively more fast than
 other high level language. Despite having pros there are also cons of this programming language, main one being remoteness of the Assembly from simple portable language.
